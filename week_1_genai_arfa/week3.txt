1 - What is true?
Machines are programmed by conditional statements for unseen data
Machines learn from data*
Machines can not work on unseen data
Machines learn not only excel data
---
2 - What are features in term of machine learning?
Data which a machine predict after training
Data on which machines are trained*
Column names of data
First half of overall data
---
3 - What is correct flow of training machine learning model?
load model -> train on data*
load scikit-learn -> design model -> train on data
load data -> design model on pandas
train on data -> design model
---
4 - What is true about labels in term of machine learning?
Data on which machines are trained
Data which is used for test purpose
Column names in dataset
Data which a machine predict after training*
---
5 - What is not true about linear regression model?
It CAN used for classification problems
It draws a straight line for prediction
It is used for regression problems
It is similar to KNN model*

1*
2
3
any number of columns

8 - What is correct syntax to train machine learning model?
model.train(features, labels)
model.train(labels, features)
model.fit(features, labels)*
model.fit(labels, features)
---
9 - What is correct syntax to separate label column from dataset?
label = data['column name']*
label = data.labels
label = data['LABELS']
label = data('column name')
